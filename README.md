# CALWC ESC Digital Tools Project

## Overview
Welcome to the CALWC ESC Digital Tools project repository. This initiative is spearheaded by the Experimentation Services Centre (ESC) with the primary aim of modernizing workflow processes to benefit members of the Canadian Armed Forces, civilians, and our experimentation teams. Our focus is on crafting digital solutions that improve efficiency, accessibility, and the overall workflow of our teams.

### Project Objectives
- Develop a platform that is accessible both internally and externally.
- Enhance the organization and retrieval of research materials to reach a broader audience.
- Implement advanced document search capabilities for easier access to relevant information.
- Create a guided process for managing and initiating new experiments.
- Automate routine tasks to streamline the experimentation team's workflow.

## Initial Approach
Our journey begins with an evaluation of existing tools and the integration of new technologies to address our needs effectively. We plan to leverage Microsoft Azure, considering its robust features for hosting our services, alongside exploring the use of D365 for workflow automation and integration. Our goal is to build a foundational suite of tools that can evolve based on user feedback and technological advancements.

### Challenges & Solutions
- **Knowledge Base:** We aim to move beyond the limitations of current systems like ACIMS by developing a custom, in-house document management system that caters to our complex data organization and security requirements.
- **D365 Integration:** Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft's Office 365 ecosystem, we are preparing for a flexible approach that allows us to adapt to changes while ensuring our tools remain effective and user-friendly.
- **Deployment:** Initial deployment will utilize existing cloud infrastructure, with plans to eventually transition to an independent environment suitable for our long-term goals.

## Needs and Proposed Solutions
- **Custom Document Management System:** Tailored to our specific needs, ensuring flexibility for future enhancements and the capability to host classified documents post-security clearance.
- **Workflow Customization:** Developing in-house digital tools that align closely with the Experimentation team's unique requirements, enhancing efficiency and relevance.
- **Collaborative Deployment:** Establishing effective collaboration with existing app teams to leverage their cloud technologies, while also laying the groundwork for future independent deployment through JDCP.
