# Master Question List

The Master Question List is a critical component of the onboarding phase. It helps define the primary questions or issues that the experiment aims to address.

### Steps:

1. **Enter Key Questions or Issues**: List the main questions or issues that need to be investigated.
2. **Information on Experiment Types**: Review the types of experiments to determine which are most appropriate for addressing the questions.

### Example:

- **Question 1**: How can we reduce lead time in the supply chain?
- **Question 2**: What are the main factors contributing to supply chain delays?
