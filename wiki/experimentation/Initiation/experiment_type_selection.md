# Experiment Type Selection

Selecting the appropriate experiment type is crucial for achieving meaningful results. Experiment types help determine the methodology and scope of the experiment.

### Experiment Types:

1. **Discovery Experiments**: Introduce novel systems, concepts, organizational structures, technologies, or other elements to observe and catalog their use.
2. **Hypothesis Testing**: Systematically eliminate possible explanations of outcomes to advance knowledge by falsifying pre-existing assumptions or hypotheses.
3. **Demonstration Experiments**: Show the effectiveness of new capabilities under operationally relevant conditions.

### Steps:

1. **Information on Experiment Types**: Review the detailed information about each experiment type.
2. **Select Experiment Type**: Choose the type that best suits your project's objectives.
