# Environment Setup

This guide outlines the steps necessary for setting up your development environment to contribute to the CALWC ESC Digital Tools project.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have administrative access to your machine to install software and make configuration changes.

## Linux Environment Setup

Linux is our primary development environment. Depending on your operating system, the setup process will vary:

- **Windows Users**: Utilize WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux). See [Linux Setup for Windows](./linux_setup.md) for a step-by-step guide.
- **MacOS Users**: Although MacOS provides a Unix-based environment, additional tools and configurations may be necessary. Instructions for MacOS users can be found in [Linux Setup for MacOS](./linux_setup.md).

## Cloning the Repository

With your Linux environment ready, clone the project repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ajsib/calwcESC/
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd calwcESC
```

## Branch Setup

Create and switch to a new branch named after your first name:

```
git checkout -b <your-first-name>
```

Confirm your current branch:

```
git branch
```

## Conclusion

You are now set up and ready to contribute to the CALWC ESC Digital Tools project. For any questions or additional assistance, refer to the `./linux_setup.md` guide or contact a project lead.
